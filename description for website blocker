This Python script creates an advanced website blocker application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library. The application allows users to block and unblock websites, schedule website blocking, and view analytics on their browsing habits. Here's an overview of its main features and components:

Website Blocking:

Users can add websites to a block list.
The application can block these websites by modifying the system's hosts file.
Blocked websites can be unblocked when needed.


Scheduling:

Users can schedule website blocks by specifying start and end times.
Scheduled blocks are displayed in a separate list.


Analytics:

The application tracks and stores data on blocking and unblocking actions.
Users can view their browsing analytics in a separate window.


User Interface:

The main window includes entry fields for website URLs and scheduling information.
Buttons for various actions (Add, Block, Unblock, Schedule, Show Analytics, Exit).
Two listboxes display currently blocked websites and scheduled blocks.


Data Persistence:

Browsing data is saved to a JSON file and loaded when the program starts.


File Handling:

The script interacts with the system's hosts file to implement website blocking.


Error Handling:

The application includes basic error checking and displays appropriate message boxes.



Key Functions:

add_website(): Adds a website to the block list.
block_website(): Implements the blocking of websites.
unblock_website(): Removes websites from the block list.
schedule_block(): Adds a scheduled block.
show_analytics(): Displays browsing analytics.
update_browsing_data(): Tracks blocking/unblocking actions.

This application provides a user-friendly interface for managing website access, helping users control their browsing habits and improve digital well-being. It's important to note that the script requires administrative privileges to modify the hosts file and may need additional security measures for real-world use. CopyRetryJ
